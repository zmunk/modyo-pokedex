
## Notes for Modyo
* When I began the project, it wasn't specified which framework to use for the API, so began coding it in NodeJS. When I realized that the project requirements had changed, I was already finished.
* The external API didn't have descriptions for some of the pokemon, so some pokemon on the pokedex have missing descriptions.
* The front end is found at http://3.125.116.161:3000, the API endpoints are found at http://3.125.116.161:3000/api/pokemon/17 (the 17 can be replaced by the id for the pokemon), and http://3.125.116.161:3000/api/list hosted on an EC2 instance running Ubuntu on AWS.
