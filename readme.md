
## Notes for Modyo
* When I began the project, it wasn't specified which framework to use for the API, so began coding it in NodeJS. When I realized that the project requirements had changed, I was already finished.
* The external API doesn't provide descriptions for some of the pokemon.
* The front end is found at {domain}, the API endpoints are found at {domain}/api/pokemon and {domain}/api/list where {domain} is whichever domain the app is being hosted at.
